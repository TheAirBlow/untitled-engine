This is a Game Maker like game engine written just for fun.
Currently is in development. It only can draw objects and that's all.

## Components

### Objects

It have it's sprite (as sounds, only the filename) and code.
*Programming object is in development.*
### Sounds
Sound just contains sound file name, yeah.
### Rooms
Room is a grid of objects.
Grid size, width, and height can be set.

## Compiling
Currently player just loads the game from project (yes, everyone can get the project)
*There is a indev "Game => Binary" feature that can be accessed by pressing "Test Binary" in the IDE.*
