# 💻 Untitled Engine
This is a GameMaker-like game engine written just for fun.

**⚠️ WARNING: Currently this is in development. ⚠️**

## ✔️ Components

### 📗 Rooms - What makes your game run
Room is a grid of Objects.

Every project should have one room minimum, beacuse the first one will be shown at startup.

@! DEV NOTE !@ - Room rendering should be rewritten

### 📘 Objects - What makes your game a game
Object is the *main* thing here. 

It does literally everything. Without it, your're not able to make anything besides the room.

*Programming objects is in development. It will be basic-like*

@! DEV NOTE !@ - Make objects programming

### 🎵 Sounds - What makes your game better
Sound just contains sound file name, yeah.

@! DEV NOTE !@ - This one is done

## ⚙️ Compiling
This game converts the project to one binary file, besides the sprites and sounds.

@! DEV NOTE !@ - Add sprites and sounds to the binary and pre-load them beacuse I was dumb to do that
